# Node Express Handlebars (OR Express-React-Views)

* Eat-Da-Burger! is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger's name on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger will also have a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the right side of the page, signifying that it has been "eaten".

#Technologies Used in this app: MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!)
